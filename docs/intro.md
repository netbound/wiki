# Intro

This is the wiki for everything I've learned, a personal **Library of Alexandria**.
Most of the time the topics covered will not be truly exhaustive, because I will
remain focused on what's relevant to me, which may not be relevant to the reader.

I am doing this because I feel like I'm forgetting things at the same rate I'm learning new stuff.
It's commonly known that writing down and synthesizing the things you've learned
improves your retention of it, and this is the case for me too. This is why I have decided to create this wiki.

This will be as much a tool for remembering as for thinking. Every time I add a new subject,
I will start from **first principles**, and refine my understanding like that.
